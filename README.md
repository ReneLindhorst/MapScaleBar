# MapScaleBar

The bar scale (also called a linear scale or graphical scale) is usually present on most maps. 
It visually shows the relationship between distances on the map and the real world.
Unfortunately ´MKMapView´ doesn't provide a build-in one.

## Requirements

MapScaleBar requires **Swift 1.2** and **iOS 8.0**.
The MapKit and CoreLocation frameworks are of course needed as well.

## Installation

Feel free to drag `MapScaleBar.swift` to your iOS Project. But it is recommended to use CocoaPods.

### CocoaPods

Using MapScaleBar with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is as easy as adding the following dependency to your `Podfile`:

```none
use_frameworks!
pod 'MapScaleBar'
```

## License

MapScaleBar is available under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for more info.
